# Impedance Tube Project Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Impedance Tube Project. This project utilizes Rust for the backend, with additional React-based frontend components and LaTeX for report generation. Below, you’ll find detailed documentation on the functionality, architecture, and components of the project, generated using Rust's documentation system.

## Overview

The Impedance Tube Project provides a multi-platform solution for conducting impedance measurements with a high level of accuracy and flexibility. This documentation includes all Rust modules, functions, and structs, organized by purpose and functionality.

## How to Use This Documentation

- **Structs and Enums**: Each struct and enum in the project is documented with fields, methods, and usage examples.
- **Functions**: Find individual functions listed under their respective modules, with descriptions of parameters and expected outcomes.
- **Modules**: Modules are organized by functionality (e.g., API, data processing, visualization), allowing easy navigation through the codebase.
- **Examples**: Where available, examples are provided to demonstrate usage.

For details about individual functions, structs, and modules, refer to the sections generated below.

## Additional Resources

For non-Rust components of this project:
- **Frontend Guide**: Documentation for the React-based frontend is available in the main repository’s `/web` directory.
- **Configuration and Setup**: Full setup instructions, including requirements for Rust, Node.js, and LaTeX, are available in the main repository’s [README.md](../README.md).

## Contributing

For those interested in contributing, please refer to our contribution guidelines in the main repository’s [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md). We welcome improvements to both the functionality and the documentation of this project.
